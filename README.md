# Real_time_Traffic_detection_TF
We worked on a project based on Deep Learning and we are able to detect objects through an image using various models, a video and real-time(web cam and cellphone camera)

The project targets to reduce the unnecessary traffic on busy roads . the model also helps the ambulance and fire brigade to move quickly throught the traffic. the app also reports the illegal crossing and jumping of red lights to the authorities immediately.
It's human tendency to break a red light when the road is free, which leads to accidents ,our model will make this kind of incedents a thing of the past.
The camaeras working on an object detection model dectects the amount of incomming traffic and reduce or increase the time of green light accordingly. 

This is an implementation of tensor flow object detection API for running it in Real time through Webcam and cellphone camera.
